# VRAM accounting

mesh-llm uses three VRAM concepts:

- **Rated VRAM**: user-facing capacity class, such as `32 GB`, derived from
  the system-reported byte count when no explicit rated value exists.
- **System-reported VRAM**: raw total bytes reported by the driver/runtime. This
  remains the source for internal calculations.
- **Reserved VRAM**: true driver/runtime reserved or unavailable bytes, when the
  platform reports them. Live used-memory counters are not reserved VRAM.

Internal fit decisions should use `system_reported_bytes - reserved_bytes`
where a true reserved value is available. Per-GPU labels should show the
rated capacity class.

Node and mesh totals are a different case. A node advertises one capacity to
the mesh (`PeerAnnouncement.vram_bytes`, reported by `/api/status` as
`my_vram_gb` and `peers[].vram_gb`), and that is the number the scheduler,
`doctor split` (`aggregate_capacity_bytes`), and model-target advice sum. Any
surface that presents a node or mesh total (the dashboard `Mesh Capacity` tile, the
peer table `VRAM` column, the chat header) must use that advertised figure so
the console, the CLI, and the API agree. Client-role nodes advertise capacity
but never serve, and the scheduler excludes them from the aggregate, so totals
exclude them as well. Summing rated classes across GPUs is display-only and
overstates schedulable capacity; the UI helpers fall back to allocatable, then
rated, inventory only for legacy payloads that carry no advertised value, never
as the primary source of a total. The itemized total / reserved / usable
breakdown from #1656 rides alongside that value: `/api/status` reports it as
`my_memory` and `peers[].memory`, the node drawer itemizes it for any node in
the mesh, and `mesh-llm gpus` prints it for the local host, while totals keep
using the single advertised figure.

| Location | Value source | Classification | Current use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `crates/mesh-llm-system/src/hardware/mod.rs` | platform tools, Skippy devices, system RAM fallback | internal source | Builds `HardwareSurvey.vram_bytes`, per-GPU `gpu_vram`, and `gpu_reserved`. |
| `crates/mesh-llm-system/src/hardware/enrichers.rs` | CUDA/NVML | internal source | Enriches NVIDIA totals and true NVML reserved memory. |
| `crates/mesh-llm-system/src/vram.rs` | system-reported bytes plus optional reserved bytes | shared semantic utility | Computes rated capacity, decimal reported GB, and allocatable bytes. |
| `crates/mesh-llm-commands/src/gpus.rs` | `HardwareSurvey` and the configured safety margin | user-facing CLI and machine JSON | Per-GPU lines show rated VRAM; JSON keeps raw `vram_bytes` and adds rated/allocatable fields. Both also print the advertised breakdown this host would announce (`advertised_memory`), with the itemized values in exact decimal GB. |
| `crates/mesh-llm/src/commands/models/formatters.rs` | `hardware::survey().vram_bytes` | mixed | Model search fit hints use reported capacity. Human summary still reports effective available capacity. |
| `crates/mesh-llm-host-runtime/src/mesh/mod.rs` | `HardwareSurvey` startup snapshot | internal and protocol | Stores node `vram_bytes`, `gpu_vram`, and `gpu_reserved_bytes` for runtime, gossip, and status. |
| `crates/mesh-llm-system/src/capacity.rs` | `HardwareSurvey` and a safety margin in bytes | shared semantic utility | Derives the advertised placement budget and its itemized breakdown (total, driver reserve, platform reserve, configured reserve, usable, system RAM, RAM-backed share), plus the MiB rounding of the configured margin. Single source for the runtime, the console and the CLI. |
| `crates/mesh-llm-host-runtime/src/mesh/capacity.rs` | `mesh_llm_system::capacity` and the effective safety margin | internal and protocol | Re-exports the breakdown under the names the mesh code uses and feeds it into the startup snapshot for gossip. |
| `crates/mesh-llm-host-runtime/src/protocol/convert.rs` | peer announcements and protobuf GPU fields | protocol/internal | Preserves additive per-GPU totals and reserved bytes across mixed-version gossip. |
| `crates/mesh-llm-host-runtime/src/api/status.rs` | node fields and GPU CSV fields | API for user-facing console | Emits raw `vram_bytes`, `reserved_bytes`, rated VRAM, and allocatable VRAM per GPU, plus the advertised breakdown as `my_memory` and `peers[].memory` (`MemoryPayload`). |
| `crates/mesh-llm-host-runtime/src/runtime/local.rs` | startup model specs and pinned GPU targets | internal | Skippy fit targets use allocatable capacity for pinned GPUs. |

| `crates/mesh-llm-ui/src/features/network/api/status-adapter.ts` | `/api/status` | user-facing dashboard | Node rows and the `Mesh Capacity` tile use advertised capacity (`my_vram_gb` / `vram_gb`), falling back to allocatable then rated inventory only when nothing is advertised; carries the advertised breakdown (`my_memory`, `peers[].memory`) into the node model as `Peer.memory`. |
| `crates/mesh-llm-ui/src/features/app-shell/lib/status-helpers.ts` | `/api/status` and topology data | user-facing dashboard helpers | Formats GPU inventory with rated capacity; node and mesh totals (`displayVramGb`, `meshGpuVram`) use advertised capacity. |
| `crates/mesh-llm-ui/src/features/chat/lib/live-chat-metrics.ts` | `/api/status` | user-facing chat header | Node count and advertised mesh capacity badges, from the same helper as the dashboard so both tabs agree. |
